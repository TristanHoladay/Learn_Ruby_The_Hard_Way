Let's build a game!

            INDIANA JONES AND THE TOMB OF PHAROAH
    You are playing as class hero Indiana Jones. Indy is on a new adventure to discover the lost tomb of Pharoah 'Ramen' (yes part of his fame is that he invented ramen noodles)
    It's 1944
    The Nazis are also looking for the lost tomb and they're hot on the heels of Indy.
    The tomb is inside the pyramid of 'Helth'
    Indy discovers the entrance to the tomb
    Inside are 4 rooms each with a passage to the next, one on each side of the pyramid.
    There is one that leads into the tomb
    To get the door open so Indy can slide down the rock tunnel to the tomb he must complete a task in all 4 rooms
    Randomly Nazis could appear trying to stop him and complete the tasks themselves
    When confronted by a nazi the game will generate randomly whether the nazi got the drop on Indy or if Indy gets the drop on the Nazi
    Indy and his Nazi foes have health that can be depleted.
    Indy also has the ability to level up his punches and kicks
    He might find a dead Nazi's gun
    At the end Indy gets the girl.

    Don't make it to where it's 50/50 chance of beating Nazi, make it in favor of player
    Random Artifacts
    *The ability to go back ? --- would need to create an engine/map that returns the previous scene

    Classes         # room classes will include combatable and player/nazi classes

    Research Points:
      using random generators
      how to correspond an object with *** or ###
      how to level-up (i think i have an idea of this though) (incremental based on number of times action is used)
