# STUDY DRILLS

  # Ruby has a BasicObject Class which is the foundation of all classes. So all classes are instances of this class, which has broad and few attributes.
  # I think that this just helps define what classes basically are. The difference between a class and an object depends in a way on how you're using it.
  # i.e a class is like an object if it is an instance of a higherclass, but it becomes the higher(ish)class when you instantiate an object from it.
