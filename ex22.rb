# LIST OF WORDS AND SYMBOLS USED SO FAR
# puts --> put string
# "" --> tells it this is the string
#
# #{} +, -, / , *, %, <, <=, >=, = --> different math functions and the #{} applies outside variables in a string
# VARIABLES
# '', """, assigning a whole string to a variable and the puts variable + variable
# print --> i think this does the same as puts but adds a \n at the end
#formatter % {} ---interesting. it takes the "format" you stringout and then when you puts something in that formatter you can assign a value for each piece of the format and then the script will output the values in the overrall format given by the formatter
# \n ---starts next string on a new line
# %Q %q --> can use for having multiple quotes in a string without having to do the \" or \'
# \t == indent or tab overrall
# \\ == \ #it's an escape sequence
# \' --> let's you do a quote within the string
# \" --> same as above
# \a --> ASCii bell for "alert" or "audible"
# \b --> ASCii backspace
# \f --> ASCii formfeed--> forces the printer to start a new page
# \n --> new line
# \r --> carriage return--> moves the "cursor" to the beginning of the line
# \uxxxx
# \v
#\ooo
# \xhh
# gets.chomp --> get string (from user) and take off the new line
# gets.chomp.to_i --> get string and convert to integer
# gets.chomp.to_f--> returns result of interpreting leading characters in string as a floating point number.
# Argument ARGV
# prompt
# $stdin.gets.chomp --> works better with arguments in play --> STANDARD INPUT (stdin)
# ARGV.first --> when you only have one argument
# open(filename) --> open is the command given to the file or variable
# txt.read or variable.read or filename.read -->.read or .close is the command to function as such or to be in the "read" mode etc...
# txt.close variable.close or filename.close
# CTRL-C
# open(filename, 'w') --> open file in write mode
# open(fielname, 'r') --> open file in read mode
# truncate --> variable.truncate(0) -->truncate is to erase
#variable.write("\n")--> write in the variable file on a new line
# copying files--> file you want to write in from the original file--> file_y.write(file.x)
# Functions --> strings of commands or methods that are then used in larger "equations"
#def, (), end
# writing functions with variables and numbers and math
# seek(0) -->go to the byte given
# += --> x = x + y --> shortcut
# return --> gives the answer or outcome and when used in a function it will give the answer no matter where the function is plugged in
